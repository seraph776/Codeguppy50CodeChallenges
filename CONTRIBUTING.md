# Welcome to GitHub docs contributing guide 

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en) :sparkles:. 
Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/seraph776/CtCI-Python-Edition/blob/main/docs/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable. In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.


## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository]() :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Check to see what [types of contributions]() we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.


## 🛠️ Submission Requirments

- ✅ Save filenames in the follow format: q001, q002 (INCLIDING FILENAME EXTENTION)
- ✅ Submissions do not have to be in sequencial order. Meaning, you can submit q030, then q001, It doesn't matter.
- ✅ Save files in the `correct programming language directory, inside a your `username` directory. For example:

### Directory Structure

```
Python/
├─ your_username/
│  ├─ q001.py
│  ├─ q025.py
│  ├─ q051.py
│ 
Javascript/
├─ your_username/
│  ├─ q001.py
│  ├─ q002.py
│  ├─ q003.py

```
✨ Look at our commit history for more examples: We'll still work with your contributions even if they don't follow these guidelines so don't let that stop you.

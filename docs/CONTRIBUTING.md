## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](https://github.com/seraph776/Codeguppy50CodeChallenges). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [the introduction to working in the docs repository]() :confetti_ball:. For more information on how we write our markdown files, see [the GitHub Markdown reference](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Check to see what [types of contributions]() we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.


## 🛠️ Submission Requirments

- ✅ Save files in the `correct programming language directory, inside a your `username` directory.
- ✅ Please fill-out and include the [SAMPLE-README.md](https://github.com/seraph776/Codeguppy50CodeChallenges/blob/main/docs/SAMPLE-README.md)  file inside your `username` root directory. 
- ✅ Save filenames in the follow format: q001, q002 (INCLUDING FILENAME EXTENTION)
- ✅ Submissions do not have to be in sequencial order. Meaning, you can submit q030, then q001, It doesn't matter.
- ✅ `Optional Task`: Include `tests` to prove that your program works. Include your unittests in sub-dirctory within your `username` dirctory called `tests`. Again, this is an optional task. See the dirctory structure below for an example:

### Directory Structure

```
Python/
├─ your_username/
|  ├─ tests/
|  |  ├─ test_q001.py
|  |  ├─ test_q025.py
|  |  ├─ test_q051.py
|  |
│  ├─ q001.py
